# Malloc
## Description
This is an open source project which was created to assist all tech newbies and students in the ALX Africa software engineering program in understanding how to build or create 'malloc' from scratch using the program breaks 'brk()' and 'sbrk()'
## Explanation
'malloc' is a library function in C that allows for allocation of memory dynamically from the heap (an area of memory where something is stored)
## Plan
1. Build a naive malloc using 'brk()' and 'sbrk()'
2. Optimize malloc for possible syscalls.
3. Implement linked lists.
4. Implement 'free'
## Contributors
This project was put together by a group of 7 ALX students called 'Tech Titans' under the leading and supervision of Julien Barbier (product @ alx_africa)
