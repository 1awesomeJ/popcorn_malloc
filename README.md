Popcorn Malloc D, 2022

This open source project called popcorn malloc was designed majorly to assist the tech newbies as well as experts in understanding how to build or create malloc from scratch using program break brk() and sbrk().

The challenge / plan is as follows:

1. Build a naive malloc.

2. Everyone can give a perfect explanation of the process, answer questions, and demonstrate answers with printing of memory addressess ... 

3. Optimize malloc for minimum possible syscalls.

4. Solve  all three coding tasks

5. Implement linked list

6. Implement free.

What is malloc in C:
Malloc in C is a library function that allows C to allocate memory dynamically from the heap.
The heap is an area of memory where something is stored.
Malloc is part of stdlib.h and to be to use it, you will need to use #include <stdlib.h>

This challenge is put together by a group of 7 students of ALX_Africa called the "Tech Titans" led and supervived by our ever ready to teach mentor Julien Barbier.
